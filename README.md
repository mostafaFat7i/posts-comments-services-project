There is a "Post" service that permits users to generate, modify, and peruse posts connected to discussions about courses.

An accompanying "Comment" service empowers users to append, revise, and peruse comments on posts or materials.

Moreover, a "Reaction" service is in place to oversee reactions associated with both posts and comments.

The system incorporates an API gateway, serving as an external interface for users to interact with. This gateway is responsible for load balancing, routing, and facilitating communication with the various services.
